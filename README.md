# Pumpkin - a Squash alternative

## Our to-do list

* *Closing bugs* - it should be possible to close bugs from the front end, and also toggle whether closed bugs are being displayed
* *Link JIRAs* - bugs.issue_url from the backend should be displayed
* *Create JIRAs* - it should be possible to easily create a JIRA for a bug, causing its URL to be linked to that bug
* *Consistent handling of deferred-loading data* - use the RemoteData pattern or similar to consistently handle Elm's loading of backend data
* *Load additional paginated occurrences* - truncated occurrences from a single bug have a "show more" button, but you can't load the older occurrences
