# Pumpkin - a Squash alternative

## Introduction

[Squash](http://squash.io/) is a popular open source tool for
exception reporting and bug analysis, and we've used it extensively at
Powershop/Flux with some success.

_Pumpkin_ is a similar and more minimal system we've built in-house to
replace Squash in our workflow, with a few specific goals:

- Simpler ingestion pipeline
- See occurrences of the same bugs across multiple environments
- Actively maintained
- Very stable and scalable
- Highly usable and adaptable
